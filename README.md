In this Repository tried to explain how back end developer can avoid most used attakcs like
~ CSRF (CROSS SITE Request Forgery)
~ XSS (CROSS SITE SCRIPTING )
~ BruteForce
~ Dos
~ Open Redirection Attacks
~ Leaked configuration files ( Not gonna mention in repo, but if you are using Visual Studio , try to use Application > Manage User Secrets . This is how your secret configuration settings like database connections, payment details and so on. User Secret just creates hashed version of configuration json files inside your computer :)
We all know that EntityFramework core avoid SQL injections by itself, that's why didn't metinon about SQL injection but at all avoid using Raw url inputs to manipulate database :)
I hope you will understand very well
