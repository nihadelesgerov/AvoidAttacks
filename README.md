In this Repository tried to explain how back end developer can avoid most used attakcs like
~ CSRF (CROSS SITE Request Forgery)
~ XSS (CROSS SITE SCRIPTING )
~ BruteForce
~ Dos
~ Open Redirection Attacks
We all know that EntityFramework core avoid SQL injections by itself, that's why didn't metinon about SQL injection but at all avoid using Raw url inputs to manipulate database :)
I hope you will understand very well
